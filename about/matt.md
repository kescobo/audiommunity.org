Matt studies antibodies, the cells that make them,
and the various factors that influence their development and targeting.
By merging experimental approaches in both mouse and human systems,
he investigates areas central to human health including critical care medicine, vaccination, and immune dysregulation/autoimmune development.
Although primarily focused on B cells,
his lab takes an intentionally broad and flexible approach to investigation,
incorporating diverse experimental methodologies and analytical approaches to deeply understand the context of immune responses.
Beyond the bench, Matt is passionate about communicating science out into the world,
building trust between the scientific community and the public,
and pushing towards effective policy around science that ultimately benefits us all.
