Kevin is an Assistant Professor of Medicine
at Tufts Medical Center.
Trained as an immunologist,
he pivoted to computational microbiology during his postdoctoral training,
and now works to make machine learning and quantitative techniques
accessible to other scientists with projects in
gut microbiome epidemiology and immunology.
He studies how microbes in the guts of kids
affect their brain development,
and works with Matt to build software tools
and run machine learning models to investigate the immune system.
