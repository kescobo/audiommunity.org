Also, we discuss efforts to use engineered antibodies to treat HIV.\n\nFirst described by Paul Erlich in the early 20th century, antibodies can bind and neutralize viruses and toxins, or target bacteria for destruction. Antibodies are proteinst that grab their targets (called their \"ligand\"), through variable regions called \"complimentarity determining regions\" (CDR).\n\nThese CDRs are variable because B-cells re-arrange their genomic DNA, mixing and matching together so-called \"V,\" \"D,\" and \"J\" (for variable, diversity and joining) gene segments, yielding tens of thousands of different possible combinations.\n\nEven more variability is possible because the junctions between these regions are not perfect, yielding mutations that may change the way that an antibody binds.\n\nIn episode 2, we talk about [a paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22932267) that seems to indicate that a particular antibody V region has evolved to bind the stalk of the influenza hemaglutanin spike protein, and [a different study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057367/) that tries to use engineered broadly neutralizing antibodies to treat HIV infections.\n\n\\---------------------------\n\n**Links:**\n\n[Influenza antibody paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22932267) (presented by Kate) [HIV antibody therapy paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057367/) (presented by Matt)","Hosts":[],"Status":{"id":2426627,"value":"Released","color":"dark-green"},"Episode number":"2","Guests":[],"Attachments":[{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/user_files/V016rMyNSju0V3oA5qwVLuxLVMiPPj5H_76d9fc34c09cd5542a401658a2c1fb09bbe65efa48960af71a7c2f104855795e.png","thumbnails":{"tiny":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/tiny/V016rMyNSju0V3oA5qwVLuxLVMiPPj5H_76d9fc34c09cd5542a401658a2c1fb09bbe65efa48960af71a7c2f104855795e.png","width":null,"height":21},"small":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/small/V016rMyNSju0V3oA5qwVLuxLVMiPPj5H_76d9fc34c09cd5542a401658a2c1fb09bbe65efa48960af71a7c2f104855795e.png","width":48,"height":48},"card_cover":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/card_cover/V016rMyNSju0V3oA5qwVLuxLVMiPPj5H_76d9fc34c09cd5542a401658a2c1fb09bbe65efa48960af71a7c2f104855795e.png","width":300,"height":160}},"visible_name":"Episode-002-graphics.png","name":"V016rMyNSju0V3oA5qwVLuxLVMiPPj5H_76d9fc34c09cd5542a401658a2c1fb09bbe65efa48960af71a7c2f104855795e.png","size":125144,"mime_type":"image/png","is_image":true,"image_width":612,"image_height":792,"uploaded_at":"2025-01-13T19:39:17.835432+00:00"}],"Audio":[{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/user_files/IpjYC66h6yxpKUsFh8eF9SWMMtjmx3AZ_5acfba39fd03f7271cd0b5725c4cc3913499f0238d5385ceac5d6caf56528693.mp3","thumbnails":null,"visible_name":"Episode_002 vaccination and antibodies_mixdown.mp3","name":"IpjYC66h6yxpKUsFh8eF9SWMMtjmx3AZ_5acfba39fd03f7271cd0b5725c4cc3913499f0238d5385ceac5d6caf56528693.mp3","size":82652797,"mime_type":"audio/mpeg","is_image":false,"image_width":null,"image_height":null,"uploaded_at":"2025-01-13T21:01:06.231514+00:00"}],"Type":{"id":2434117,"value":"Main episode","color":"cyan"},"Table":[]},{"id":46,"order":"3.00000000000000000000","Title":"Camilla's Science is Cursed","Season":{"id":2426620,"value":"1","color":"green"},"Release date":"2018-08-20","Duration in seconds":null,"Description":"I swear, we know how to count; this episode was originally recorded back in January, but Camilla's audio file was weirdly corrupted.

Plus she refuses to drink on the job.\n\nDonate to us [on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/audiommunity)!\\\nLike us [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/audiommunity/)!\\\nAnd don't forget to share us with your friends so we can grow!\n\nEDIT: Sorry if this showed up in your feed late - there was a mistake in formatting :-(\n\n### **LINKS**\n\nThe Paper: [Strains of bacterial species induce a greatly varied acute adaptive immune response: the contribution of the accessory genome](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006726)\\\n[Short Path Distillery](http://shortpathdistillery.com/)\\\n[Organ Preservation Alliance](https://www.organpreservationalliance.org/) (where Kate works now)","Hosts":[],"Status":{"id":2426627,"value":"Released","color":"dark-green"},"Episode number":"30","Guests":[],"Attachments":[{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/user_files/jTHEYeNWgyVlkghV5KqJOA0p5RTSAFgX_556ddf00422d15119ed2de0d65e04b2e245ad16762f2fe713b43344f199a633c.jpg","thumbnails":{"tiny":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/tiny/jTHEYeNWgyVlkghV5KqJOA0p5RTSAFgX_556ddf00422d15119ed2de0d65e04b2e245ad16762f2fe713b43344f199a633c.jpg","width":null,"height":21},"small":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/small/jTHEYeNWgyVlkghV5KqJOA0p5RTSAFgX_556ddf00422d15119ed2de0d65e04b2e245ad16762f2fe713b43344f199a633c.jpg","width":48,"height":48},"card_cover":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/card_cover/jTHEYeNWgyVlkghV5KqJOA0p5RTSAFgX_556ddf00422d15119ed2de0d65e04b2e245ad16762f2fe713b43344f199a633c.jpg","width":300,"height":160}},"visible_name":"Human_neutrophil_ingesting_MRSA.jpg","name":"jTHEYeNWgyVlkghV5KqJOA0p5RTSAFgX_556ddf00422d15119ed2de0d65e04b2e245ad16762f2fe713b43344f199a633c.jpg","size":244567,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","is_image":true,"image_width":1280,"image_height":835,"uploaded_at":"2025-01-13T19:53:03.237191+00:00"}],"Audio":[{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/user_files/MtQYGts2EQw9R7sTn50FrgEGh5kF4hvD_5cccc4c34aafaae2c504defed54131159cb41e9865f8d4c595e64bf878f2df17.mp3","thumbnails":null,"visible_name":"Episode30.mp3","name":"MtQYGts2EQw9R7sTn50FrgEGh5kF4hvD_5cccc4c34aafaae2c504defed54131159cb41e9865f8d4c595e64bf878f2df17.mp3","size":103645046,"mime_type":"audio/mpeg","is_image":false,"image_width":null,"image_height":null,"uploaded_at":"2025-01-13T19:53:44.934046+00:00"}],"Type":{"id":2434117,"value":"Main episode","color":"cyan"},"Table":[]},{"id":50,"order":"7.00000000000000000000","Title":"Giant Bag of Autoimmunity","Season":{"id":2426620,"value":"1","color":"green"},"Release date":"2018-01-22","Duration in seconds":null,"Description":"Blame Kevin for the delay on this one - it's hard to edit podcasts in Hong Kong.\n\nToday (well, three weeks ago), Matt and Kevin talked about epitope spreading in Lupus, and a ton of crazy mouse models that allowed researchers to dissect the way a single auto-reactive B-cell clone can spread the disease party to its neighbors.\n\nAlso in this episode - Kevin complains about politicians' views on global warming (I can't link the map because of the government shutdown), and Matt totally doesn't have any conflicts of interest on this paper...\n\nDonate to us [on Patreon](http://patreon.com/audiommunity)!

We discuss what killer T-cells are, how and why they get exhausted, and new research that points towards potential therapy for everything from HIV to cancer.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nLinks:\n\nThe paper: [Restoring function in exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic viral infection](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7077/abs/nature04444.html)","Hosts":[],"Status":{"id":2426627,"value":"Released","color":"dark-green"},"Episode number":"7","Guests":[],"Attachments":[],"Audio":[{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/user_files/xFMnbhgorazRjz6GSdBKyXKAsEh5X8LO_02835f5d49b6d941bc531ee8296fa7659d9d425926be853ddba24813f1803dca.mp3","thumbnails":null,"visible_name":"Episode_007 Hot dog buns hard lines and floppy bits.mp3","name":"xFMnbhgorazRjz6GSdBKyXKAsEh5X8LO_02835f5d49b6d941bc531ee8296fa7659d9d425926be853ddba24813f1803dca.mp3","size":73139305,"mime_type":"audio/mpeg","is_image":false,"image_width":null,"image_height":null,"uploaded_at":"2025-01-13T21:05:50.215980+00:00"}],"Type":{"id":2434117,"value":"Main episode","color":"cyan"},"Table":[]},{"id":89,"order":"37.00000000000000000000","Title":"Just a Huge Distraction","Season":{"id":2426620,"value":"1","color":"green"},"Release date":"2014-06-04","Duration in seconds":null,"Description":"In this episode, Kevin talks with [Pamela Ronald](https://plus.google.com/u/0/103673673442691110018/posts), professor of plant pathology at the University of California, Davis.

This receptor shares many features with Toll-like receptors, and the role of Xa21 was shown a year before TLRs were implicated in immunity.\n\nWe also talk about recent work from Ronald's lab, in which bananas, a staple crop for millions of people in Africa, are genetically engineered to express Xa21 in order to protect them from a devastating bacterial infection.\n\n\\---------------------\n\n**Links:**\n\nThe paper: [Transgenic expression of the rice Xa21 pattern-recognition receptor in banana (Musa sp.) confers resistance to Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24612254)\n\nPamela Ronald's [home on the internet](http://cropgeneticsinnovation.org/)\n\n[Food Matters Blog](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/food-matters/)\n\n[One of Kevin's Screeds](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/05/30/allergic-to-science-proteins-and-allergens-in-our-genetically-engineered-food/) about GMO's (there are many more - just ask!)","Hosts":[],"Status":{"id":2426627,"value":"Released","color":"dark-green"},"Episode number":"6","Guests":[],"Attachments":[{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/user_files/jw1YfZkVl5uVYAD629PImBkq3lGvNvqR_b99323bb18a7c5ca5fbe9bf8a65a37d60ce8c9970119aaf61fb9626c1a9f6f8c.png","thumbnails":{"tiny":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/tiny/jw1YfZkVl5uVYAD629PImBkq3lGvNvqR_b99323bb18a7c5ca5fbe9bf8a65a37d60ce8c9970119aaf61fb9626c1a9f6f8c.png","width":null,"height":21},"small":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/small/jw1YfZkVl5uVYAD629PImBkq3lGvNvqR_b99323bb18a7c5ca5fbe9bf8a65a37d60ce8c9970119aaf61fb9626c1a9f6f8c.png","width":48,"height":48},"card_cover":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/card_cover/jw1YfZkVl5uVYAD629PImBkq3lGvNvqR_b99323bb18a7c5ca5fbe9bf8a65a37d60ce8c9970119aaf61fb9626c1a9f6f8c.png","width":300,"height":160}},"visible_name":"Screen-Shot-2014-06-04-at-3.49.18-PM-296x300.png","name":"jw1YfZkVl5uVYAD629PImBkq3lGvNvqR_b99323bb18a7c5ca5fbe9bf8a65a37d60ce8c9970119aaf61fb9626c1a9f6f8c.png","size":141390,"mime_type":"image/png","is_image":true,"image_width":296,"image_height":300,"uploaded_at":"2025-01-13T20:40:04.550574+00:00"}],"Audio":[{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/user_files/Z11xOWyC8qMuhV1hUh89JVRC6I7J4UYY_88306cdd1c2d18238690c6bc6e36694a981fddf2eb88d68afd5301ad48082e0d.mp3","thumbnails":null,"visible_name":"Episode 6 Just a Huge Distraction.mp3","name":"Z11xOWyC8qMuhV1hUh89JVRC6I7J4UYY_88306cdd1c2d18238690c6bc6e36694a981fddf2eb88d68afd5301ad48082e0d.mp3","size":35873357,"mime_type":"audio/mpeg","is_image":false,"image_width":null,"image_height":null,"uploaded_at":"2025-01-13T21:05:34.849135+00:00"}],"Type":{"id":2434117,"value":"Main episode","color":"cyan"},"Table":[]},{"id":90,"order":"38.00000000000000000000","Title":"When the Carnies Roll In","Season":{"id":2426620,"value":"1","color":"green"},"Release date":"2014-05-14","Duration in seconds":null,"Description":"[Click to Download](https://archive.org/download/Episode005WhenTheCarniesRollIn/Episode%20005%20-%20When%20the%20Carnies%20Roll%20in.mp3)\n\nIn Episode 5, we're talking about [neutrophils](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54f874c3e4b087c5398e230b/54f8895be4b02517d1fd0599/54f88963e4b02517d1fd0632/1425574243262/?format=original), and the [special way they die](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_extracellular_traps).\n\nNeutrophils are specialized for killing things. Often described as the kamikaze pilots of the immune system, they typically swarm into sights of inflammation to kill everything that looks out of place. Neutrophils don't typically live very long, and then they die, they can do so by committing suicide in a way that causes further destruction.\n\nLots of cells commit suicide (we talk about that too), but neutrophils have a special suicide called \"NETosis,\" where they release their genomic DNA to envelop and kill bacteria.\n\nMatt and I have been a bit delinquent with the graphics, but we're working on more, as well as some animations (both of us are trying to learn to make animations in HTML5 at the moment).\n\nHope you enjoy the show, and don't forget to [rate us on itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/audiommunity/id829984733%20) or [like us on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/audiommunity).\n\n\\---------\n\nThe paper: [Brinkmann et. al. \"Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Kill Bacteria\" *Nature.* (2004)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15001782)\n\n[Videos of neutrophil swarming](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v498/n7454/full/nature12175.html#videos) (the second one is my favorite)\n\n[Ticking clock sound effect](https://soundcloud.com/kazukied2/mechanical-clock-sound-effect) by soundcloud user [kazukied2](https://soundcloud.com/kazukied2/)","Hosts":[],"Status":{"id":2426627,"value":"Released","color":"dark-green"},"Episode number":"5","Guests":[],"Attachments":[{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/user_files/VF89AAIAqeorHCrKvHhEYCugPUouVzqg_00b58d81c4f31e81f5b05c034da323507b84b89dd3ee32fef19e0c6256521456.png","thumbnails":{"tiny":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/tiny/VF89AAIAqeorHCrKvHhEYCugPUouVzqg_00b58d81c4f31e81f5b05c034da323507b84b89dd3ee32fef19e0c6256521456.png","width":null,"height":21},"small":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/small/VF89AAIAqeorHCrKvHhEYCugPUouVzqg_00b58d81c4f31e81f5b05c034da323507b84b89dd3ee32fef19e0c6256521456.png","width":48,"height":48},"card_cover":{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/card_cover/VF89AAIAqeorHCrKvHhEYCugPUouVzqg_00b58d81c4f31e81f5b05c034da323507b84b89dd3ee32fef19e0c6256521456.png","width":300,"height":160}},"visible_name":"NETs.png","name":"VF89AAIAqeorHCrKvHhEYCugPUouVzqg_00b58d81c4f31e81f5b05c034da323507b84b89dd3ee32fef19e0c6256521456.png","size":229779,"mime_type":"image/png","is_image":true,"image_width":592,"image_height":408,"uploaded_at":"2025-01-13T20:41:11.834226+00:00"}],"Audio":[{"url":"https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/user_files/cXfTgP06XzRLXDQb8itiJaQqzohYGH53_9ecfc3cfc0b96dc29aa897051007fa900cec6b7ee94d6684542ddfa1b390aafb.mp3","thumbnails":null,"visible_name":"Episode 005 - When the Carnies Roll in.mp3","name":"cXfTgP06XzRLXDQb8itiJaQqzohYGH53_9ecfc3cfc0b96dc29aa897051007fa900cec6b7ee94d6684542ddfa1b390aafb.mp3","size":48675833,"mime_type":"audio/mpeg","is_image":false,"image_width":null,"image_height":null,"uploaded_at":"2025-01-13T21:03:15.052959+00:00"}],"Type":{"id":2434117,"value":"Main episode","color":"cyan"},"Table":[]},{"id":91,"order":"39.00000000000000000000","Title":"Willy Nilly Brownian Motion","Season":{"id":2426620,"value":"1","color":"green"},"Release date":"2014-04-25","Duration in seconds":null,"Description":"[Click for mp3](https://archive.org/download/Episode004WillyNillyBrownianMotion/Episode_004_willy_nilly_brownian_motion.mp3) After a long absence, we're back!
