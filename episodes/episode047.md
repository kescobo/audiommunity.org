Against all expectations, there's RNA attached to the surface of cells.
Why? Who knows! 
But it almost certainly has implications for the immune system.
As Matt and Kevin discuss in this episode,
it turns out that cells add sugars to these RNAs (glycosylation)
to hide them from the innate immune system,
especially during apoptosis.
