image caption2: Chemical structure of cGAMP - the "A" is on the bottom left, the "G" on the upper right and the "cyclic" part is that linkage in the middle between the sugars and the phosphate groups.

In this episode, we talk about the innate immune system's Trojan cow strategy - using a cyclic dinucleotide as a signaling molecule means that viruses can package the seeds of their own destruction.

Meanwhile, Matt and Kate throw Kevin under the bus with regards to alcohol consumption, and Matt expounds on the security threat posed by infectious cattle.
