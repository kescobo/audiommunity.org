Matt and Kevin discuss a new paper about the "subfornical organ"
which (once again) undermines the idea of immune privilege,
and also points to an interesting evolutionary question:
why would T-cells migrating from fat to the brain affect hunger response?

Also, Matt tries to speak through virus-mediated destruction of his trachea,
and Kevin keeps trying to make Buddhist immunology a thing.
