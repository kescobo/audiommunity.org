This week - Evidence that viruses drive the evolution of their hosts - who would have guessed? Matt struggles to remember how evolution works, and Kate and Kevin yell past each other about open peer review.

We initially recorded this episode a month ago, but Kevin messed up his audio settings and his recording was unusable. So sorry as always for the delay, but we hope you enjoy!
