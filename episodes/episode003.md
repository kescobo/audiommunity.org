Today, we're talking the *other* immunity (that both Kate and Kevin happen to study). Neglected for nearly one hundred years, the innate immune system is required for getting inflammation going, and without it, adaptive immunity wouldn't function.

We discuss a [landmark paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2700931) by the late Charles Janeway that set the stage for the revolution in understanding, and a [newer study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057367/#__ffn_sectitle) that aims to use our modern understanding of the innate immune system to make better vaccines. Check back later for some graphics and explainers.

CORRECTION: "Variola" causes smallpox, not chickenpox. The chickenpox virus is "Varicella." Thanks to listener Robin Datta for the correction.
