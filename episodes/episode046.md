Matt and Kevin take a humbling look back a classic 1989 immunology paper
from the lab of David Baltimore (RIP)
in which the gene encoding RAG-1,
one of two genes that is responsible for
the VDJ recombination -
a mechanism for the generation of diversity
in the adaptive immune system.

But most of this conversation is about
the wildly complicated molecular biology
they had to use in 1989.
