In this episode, we're joined by Abbie Smith, a postdoctoral fellow studying HIV at Emory University, and author of the popular (and always wonderful) ERV, a blog at [scienceblogs.com](http://scienceblogs.com).

We're talking about HIV research, and a controversial group trying to crowd fund an HIV vaccine. Along the way we discuss Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs), vaccine research generally, and the way that science is funded in the US.
