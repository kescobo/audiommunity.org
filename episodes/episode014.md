We're back! And I know what you're thinking - it's about damn time. We have excuses, but we won't bore you with them.

In this episode, we're talking about the placental microbiome - that is, the bacteria that hang around a developing fetus in the womb. Wait, there are bacteria hanging around a developing fetus? Apparently!

Matt also waxes poetic on the immunology of pregnancy, and Kate tells us why family planning might someday involve infecting yourself with worms.

Enjoy!
