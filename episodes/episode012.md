Image caption2: This is in no way related to the episode, but it's the figure Kate made for a [recent review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25800355). It's so good, you almost can't tell it was done in PowerPoint

Welcome to spring from everyone at Audiommunity! To celebrate the return of the warm(ish) weather, we discuss [a paper](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1074761313004391/1-s2.0-S1074761313004391-main.pdf?_tid=f09399f0-e46c-11e4-b3a9-00000aab0f6c&acdnat=1429211907_1552c31e87678c5dfc5613aef596cadd) looking at immune responses to bee venom, and the underlying causes of environmental allergy. In doing so, we focus in on the mast cell – the immune mediators of allergy and anaphylaxis – and why they may actually be helpful in helping you (or your more worm-exposed ancestors) fight off intestinal parasites. Ever wonder where histamines come from? Why your skin turns red when you scratch it? Why you should never take bee pollen as a supplement? What eosinophils and basophils are? Well we can't answer that last one, but for the rest, give a listen!
