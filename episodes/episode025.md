OMG, Audiommunity is back! With a... vengeance? That doesn't make any sense. But we're back!

We've got a couple of new hosts - Please give a warm welcome to [Chadene Tremaglio and Camilla Engblom](http://emmunity.org/about/)! Kate is still holed up in a cave (lab) trying to wrap up her PhD. But she'll soon return... we hope...

Audiommunity is now accepting donations via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/audiommunity). The way it works is that you set up a pledge amount that we'll get each time we release an episode (up to a maximum you set). We'll keep doing this for free, but if you value the podcast, please consider [tossing a buck](https://www.patreon.com/audiommunity) or two our way!
