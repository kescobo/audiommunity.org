Things are bleak in American academia here in 2025.
Here, Matt and Kevin speak with Abbie Smith,
an assistant professor at Emory's Hope Clinic,
where she researches HIV and oversees clinical trials
assessing the prevention and treatment of people with HIV.
As you might imagine, the current regime isn't super happy
about her work.

No paper in this episode, just some honest kvetching
and an inspiring speach from Abbie about what we can aspire to.
