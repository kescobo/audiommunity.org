In this episode, Matt and Kevin are joined by [Nicole Ackermans](https://nicoleackermans.com)
to discuss her recent review paper tracing human thoughts about headbutting
from 10,000 BCE to the present day.
How are animals like bighorn sheep and woodpeckers protected
from brain injury?
Actually, wait... **are** they protected from brain injury?

It's a wonderful romp of a paper, but with some serious undertones,
since misinformation about animal biology
is being commercialized and promoted to make people feel better
about gladiatorial sports like football.
