Are you bleak, disenchanted, stressed out, and unhappy? 
No, we're not talking (only) about US politics,
we're talking about Postdocs! 
And about a new paper showing how academic success
is linked to publications.

Plus, an overview of the academic track,
some alternatives to postdocs and faculty careers,
and kvetching about the current administration's apparent indifference
to everything having to do with science.
