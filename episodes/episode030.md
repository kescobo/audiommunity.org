No, your eyes aren't deceiving you, and yes, we know how to count... Episode 29 is still in limbo as Camilla valiantly attempts to re-record just her portion. 

In this episode, Kevin and Camilla discuss *Salmonella* virulence,* and how different strains alter the immunogenicity of pathogens. Oh, and Kate's here too... KATE'S BACK!! WOO!! Dr. Franz has a new job, but is just as snarky and ill-prepared as ever. Plus she refuses to drink on the job.
