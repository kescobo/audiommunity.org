Bacteria have immune systems? Even adaptive immune systems? And autoimmunity?
Well... sort of.

In this episode Kate and Kevin discuss a new paper
showing that anti-phage defenses of bacteria can provide really broad protection
if they just get expressed at a higher level.
So why don't they?
Trade-offs of course - always with the evolutionary trade-offs.
