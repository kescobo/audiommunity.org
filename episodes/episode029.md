I swear, we know how to count; this episode was originally recorded back in January, but Camilla's audio file was weirdly corrupted. And in this attempt, Chadene's computer exploded, but we soldiered on without her.

In this episode, we're discussing Camilla's PhD paper, in which bone-forming cells promote tumors in the lung by activating specialized neutrophils. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me either, but it's beautiful work.
