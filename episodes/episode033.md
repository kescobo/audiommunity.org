Aaaaand we're back! After a 7 year hiatus,
6 kids (3 for Matt, 2 for Kevin, 3 for Kate),
2 professor positions and an industry career,
the OG audiommunity crew is back to recording!

In this episode, we talk about where we've been,
what we've been doing, and where we hope to take the podcast going forward.
