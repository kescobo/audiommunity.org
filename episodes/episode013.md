Finally! This episode was recorded back in June, but I (Kevin) have been super busy (/super lazy) and only now got it posted. For those of you that are still subscribed, thanks for not abandoning us! Though it took some time, I think this conversation was worth the wait.

In this episode, we discuss the moral implications of doing experiments on babies without brains, and editing the genomes of unborn humans. I reveal my nature as a moral monster, and Kate can't resist bringing up Kim Kardashian's artificial selection of her own offspring.
