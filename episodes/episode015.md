This week, we're discussing DRACOs - not the Harry Potter character, a "new" class of antiviral therapeutics that links up the double-stranded RNA-binding part of one protein to the cell-death (apoPtosis)-activating part of a different protein.

The paper we're discussing was published over 4 years ago, but the idea hasn't seemed to take off - we'll discuss the promise of the idea, but also our concerns and skepticism, the later of which is particularly important since the original author is now embarking on a crowd funding campaign to get more money to study it.
