In this episode, we're talking about the OAS-RNaseL virus-sensing pathway,
and the passage of its product, 2,5-oligoadenylate, through gap junctions.

Also in this episode, Matt relives his gel-running trauma,
Kate remembers getting scooped,
and Kevin still can't figure out his terrible, horrible, no good, very bad internet.
