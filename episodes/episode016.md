image caption: Taking the breaks off of the immune system can get it to attack cancer cells

In this episode, Matt and Kevin discuss checkpoint blockade cancer immunotherapy (wow, that's a mouthful). When cancer stamps down the breaks of the immune system, cutting the break line can allow T-cells to do their job.

Meanwhile, Kate's teeth are falling out of her head, and Matt can't even remember what scotch he's drinking.

This episode was recorded Friday, Jan 8th... we're getting better folks.
